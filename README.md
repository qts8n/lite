# lite

lite is a lightweight text editor written mostly in Lua â€” it aims to provide
something practical, pretty, *small* and fast, implemented as simply as
possible; easy to modify and extend, or to use without doing either.

This fork provides more out of the box plugins, including custom ones, themes,
QoL improvements and functionality. This fork also strips off any trace of
Windows support, so be careful.

## Requirements

- SDL2 library

## Building

```bash
./build.sh
```
